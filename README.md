# webhook-telegram-bot-shablon
Hi there.

With this program, you can create a simple and advanced webhook telegram bot, or rather a template, in python. (First, it's up to you)

In it you can easily send messages to the bot and receive messages from the bot, in addition, the buttons are ready and made easy, states and dispatchers are also ready. In general, with this template you can create a Telegram bot

You just enter the .env file: 
```sh
BOT_TOKEN = Bot token
ADMINS = [admin_ids]
NGROK_URL = ngrok url
```
and run the app.py file which contains practical examples

Thank you very much for your attention
